# Medical-Costs-Analysis-Project

## Executive Summary

This report presents an analysis of medical charges based on a dataset of 1,000 patient records. The analysis examines the relationship between medical charges and various demographic and health factors including age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and geographic region.

## Dataset Overview

- **Total Records**: 1,000 patient personal details
- **Key Variables**: Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker Status, Region, Charges

## Objectives:
- Is there a correlation between age of patient and their medical charges?
- Which gender has highest medical costs?
- Does BMI impact medical costs?
- Is there a correlation between patient's number of children and their medical charges?
- Does being a smoker impact their medical costs?
- Which region has highest medical costs?
